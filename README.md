Uber Traffic Volume Prediction – Internship Project
===================================================
Project Overview:

This project was completed as part of my Data Analytics / Data Science Internship, where I worked on predicting hourly traffic volumes at major road junctions using historical traffic, weather, and event data.

The objective was to build a predictive model that helps estimate traffic congestion patterns, which can support traffic planning, routing optimization, and urban mobility decisions.

Dataset Description
===================
The project uses multiple datasets, including:
Traffic volume data (hourly traffic counts)
Weather data (temperature, rainfall, conditions)
Event data (public events impacting traffic)
> Note: These datasets were provided internally for academic/internship purposes and may not be publicly available.

Tools & Technologies
====================
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy – Data cleaning & preprocessing
- Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data visualization
- Scikit-learn – Model building & evaluation
- Jupyter Notebook

Key Analysis Performed
======================
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on traffic trends
- Feature engineering using:
  - Time-based features (hour, day, weekday/weekend)
  - Weather conditions
  - Event indicators
  - Correlation analysis to identify key traffic drivers
  - Predictive modeling for hourly traffic volume forecasting

Model Outcome
=============
- Built and evaluated predictive models to forecast traffic volume
- Identified peak traffic hours, high-impact weather conditions, and event-driven spikes
- Model insights can be used for better traffic management and operational planning

Key Learnings
=============
- Real-world time-series data handling
- Feature engineering for predictive analytics
- Model evaluation and business interpretation of results
- End-to-end data science project execution
